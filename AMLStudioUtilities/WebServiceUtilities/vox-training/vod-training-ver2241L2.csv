"3048e404-c676-56d2-8c98-7d401e68ea14","'Written Off' Credit Cards and their inability to be renewed for payments. . Having taken a break from Xbox in order to focus on real life events I'd forgotten to cancel my subscription and since taken the money out of the account I used for online purchases. ††Sometime later I return to try and play Xbox using the same card and account I previously used and find it wouldn't work. Upon talking to support I'd learned that since the subscription wasn't cancelled and payments weren't going through, the system automatically cancelled my subscription for me but 'wrote off' that account and no longer allowed me to make purchases with that card. ††Now this was my mistake having not cancelled my subscription, but I then also learned I couldn't use that Card EVER again. I personally only have the one card so I don't have to manage many, which now puts me in a rather inconvenient position as I now have to buy physical codes which come at retailer price instead of directly from Microsoft. ††I can understand why this system is in place, but not having the ability to remove the blocks on cards in the event someone made a mistake and leave them to be effectively banned from using that card again forever seems...counter productive. I honestly don't want to go out and buy physical codes every time I want money in my Microsoft account or subscription. ††TL;DR - The inability to have blocks removed from credit cards leaving them banned FOREVER should be remedied so that people who make mistakes or want to use their card again ever - can do so. Or Remove the whole banning system to begin with and add in a Auto opt-out if someone doesn't pay for sub for x amount of months. ††Further - I didn't get any notifications about this either while I was absent from Xbox Live. Nothing to warn me this type of action would be taken against my account. Lovely surprise. Especially since I was told to contact my bank and everything before finally finding the cause on their own end.","None--Other None"

There's no way to know how much money you're making until you're paid. All you can see is the amount you were already paid (which for some reason shows up as a big text even though once you got that money you don't really care about that number anymore) and how many paid downloads you have (which doesn't include the price charged for it, so if you ever change the app price, you can no longer figure out your revenue)   If you need an example of what publishers should see when they open the dashboard, check out pubcenter.microsoft.com. Not that the reports over there are much better but at least that most crucial data point is the most clear and visible number on the home page (as it is on any publisher portal).   If you're worried about paid transactions that won't go through, there's a simple solution, call it Estimated Revenue. Add the fine print that the numbers are subject to finalizing purchases or whatever legal wording you need there. ","Business Operations--Business Analysis"

The ""new"" idea of Family, since Family Gold was discontinued, makes it difficult and cumbersome for parents to manage the finances of their children. Currently, the only ""valid"" payment options for these payments are credit cards or paypal, neither of which are available to children.   The only way to pay for a child's account is to either log in and set up a credit card for their account or to give a prepaid gift card for the account. The former is cumbersome in that it requires you to also remove the card or face the prospect of unexpected charges when a child inadvertently buys things; then latter insures you will leave excess credit in the account since the prepaid cards are never for exact amounts of purchases.  Under the old Family Gold plan, parents could transfer credit to child accounts. The same should be possible with the current structure at least when accounts are in fact linked as family members (which ours are).  I'm putting this forward at the recommendation of Chat Support after a long conversation there which got me nowhere on using my credit to purchase a gift card, something Microsoft does not allow.","None--Other None"

"134802dd-00bb-4307-8acf-f0e626b877b1","Checks and balances for the Support Team . The story so far...I own a Xbox One and my Kinect is broken so I contact Support through a chat window. As I have already exhausted all trouble shooting techniques it was quickly determined that I would have to send in my Kinect for repair. I contacted Support on October 28, 2014 at approximately 10:30 am MST. The first Support person explained to me my options of Standard Exchange and Advanced Exchange. During this process it was explained to me that the Standard would not cost me anything except the time it took to diagnose the Kinect. The Advanced Exchange would cost me just $10, with a ""hold"" of retail value of a Kinect. This was not explained to my properly. Here is my Support person explaining the ""hold"" of monies. ""It's like this wherein we sent out the replacement consoles first (3-5 business days). After receiving the unit, the customers are then entitled to send in their non-working unit within 14 days to prevent having charges on their account. Our system process a holding fee 10 USD on their credit card as assurance that the customer will be sending in their non-working unit."" As it is stated above, there is no mention of the $149 ""hold"" so that the customer, me, sends back the Kinect. Upon receipt for the Advanced Exchange, then do I get a clear definition of the amount of money being taken out and the actual process. My first question is why is the canned response for the receipt not the canned response for Support. Why do they differ? Secondly, upon said receipt I decided to cancel the Advanced Exchange because it was not clearly explained. I was told I could not cancel my Exchange for 24 hours. This is unacceptable and I tried to reason with the Support Manager who ultimately told me nothing could be done and then proceeded to hang up on me. This process took two and half hours of my day. A couple hours later I decided to open a new Support ticket to try and resolve this. Again, I was stonewalled with ""processes"" that would not enable my cancellation. I woke up this morning, October 29, 2014, to an email that had been sent at 4:30 am MST stating my new Kinect had been sent. So again I have to open a new Support ticket and to my surprise someone was able to cancel my order before the 24 hour period expired. My problem is two fold, being why was someone able to cancel my order before the 24 hour period but after the product was sent? Why is there a process in place that does not allow for cancellations? Why was the product sent to me after several stated attempts to cancel the order? Another problem is the email sent to me this morning. It has a subject line of ""Xbox 360 Service Request."" That is incorrect and even though my order number clearly states a Xbox One Kinect, the email read differently. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. My laundry list of problems continues with how this process played out. Where is the checks and balances within the system? Why should the customer have to harass Support to make anything happen? The whole cancellation process needs an overhaul. And lastly my experience with a Support Manager named Earl. This gentleman was rude and continued to talk around my questions and concerns. Not once was there ever an apology for the confusion and for the rudeness I experienced from this gentleman. There is also no way to report this person or this experience. I was told to post this problem on a Xbox-sponsored forum. There is no way to make a formal complaint or to make sure this does not happen in the future. I continue to receive assurances that this problem will be looked into but my faith is gone. If the simple act of training Tier 1 Support people is lost, then how can Microsoft assure me that the process will be examined and the people will be held accountable for their actions? Now I have to make a report with the BBB and look into third party representation in order for anyone to actually care. I felt as though I was treated as a bag of money and not a person with a bonafide problem.","Learn, Try or Buy--Self-Help Support|Business Operations--Other Business Operations"

Suffer with negative ratings because of broken functionality with apps that worked under 8.0 or without a VPN. 2. Prompt all users with a warning that they should make sure that the VPN is disabled before proceeding... including most users who have not enabled a VPN in the first place... and popping such a message almost every time the app is launched. 3. Re-write large portions of code as native code and use the Winsock APIs instead of the WinRT.

This would allow people to use the same dev accounts at work and at home - and if they wanted to publish privately they would then pay the publisher fee.

I have 2 Buttons inside a StackPanel and the events I have on them are:  PointerPressed PointerEntered PointerReleased PointerExited PointerCanceled PointerCaptureLost  PointerPressed and PointerEntered share the same event handler and the rest (the ""deactivation"" events) share the same event handler. If I press one button my ""activated"" event handler is triggered and if I drag off it my ""deactivated"" event handler is triggered but if I then drag onto the second button the ""activated"" event handler isn't triggered again. Strangely, if I start by dragging from off the StackPanel onto one of the buttons the ""activated"" event handler is triggered. I assume that it is something to do with the internal pointer management stuff but can't seem to find a workaround. Does anyone know why this is happening and how I can get it to work how I want? Thanks for your time. Edit Okay I've been researching some stuff and I've come across CapturePointer() and ReleasePointerCapture() but this seems to be broken - If I capture the pointer, when I take my finger off the screen, PointerReleased doesn't even get hit. I've also realized why the ""dragging from off the SP onto one of the buttons causes it to 'activate'"" - this is because when a button is pressed it doesn't route its event but fires a Click event - meaning the same pointer cannot fire a PointerEntered event of another button, but if it starts outside a Button it will trigger PointerEntered.

Here are the specifics I noticed:  - You can easily create a `loop` in the UI by just navigating on the properties page of an azure instance. For example, go to the summary of a cache which has 2 instances. Select one of the instances. On the summary pane shown on the right, select one of the instances. A new pane will be open for every item you select. - Deleted items still show on the filter  - Deleted items still show in the main page (pinned elements)  - It's hard to access previously created items, unless you pin those to the main UI.  I also miss some sort of grouping or hierarchy. Many of the azure components are related (e.g., sites & databases), but they all seem to be accessible from different entry points. It's hard to see exactly how they relate, unless you carefully map these or have some naming convention to help...  My 2 cents...  ","Learn, Try or Buy--Learn, Try, Buy UI or UX"

Those apps are as good as useless to consumers (cheap website wrappers etc.) and still have dozens of maximum ratings shortly after being released. Those apps get ranked high in the listings and take away the place of the few others that actually are good.  Reporting usually takes several days or more than one week until something actually happens. Also, I've heard that MS just warns those devs, but even lets them keep obvious fake max ratings. This just makes me angry as a serious developer!  Suggestion: Introduce a system with `trusted` developers who can release apps as quick and easy as it is now. New ones should still need manual review by MS employees like it used to be at WP7 times.  And in the case of a dev found to break the rules, ban them completely. Of course they can come back, but they'll have to re-pay the registration fee again, and when being banned again every week, it won't pay out for them anymore.

"3853173b-e48d-c19d-9f39-5a8ef1e6edf0","Gold Plan: Arcade Time (Live plan based on usage or time spent). I currently cannot justify buying any of the xbox live plans available. You see, I work all the time and am only able to play for a few hours on the weekends, and then, only sometimes. Sometimes I have no desire to play xbox, or sometimes my friends want to take me out to do stuff. I played on xbox live multiplayer throughout highschool, so I know it's a good experience. I would love to get the 12 month plan price, but given that I play the xbox so little -- now that I'm out of college and working all the time -- I can't justify buying any of the plans. If I were to buy a 12 month plan, I would only be playing -- at maximum -- on about 104 days (52 weekends times 2 days per weekend) out of those 12 months. 104 days times a few hours each day means that I'm only playing 13 days (total time) out of the year. A 60 dollar price is too much for a service that I only use 13 days a year, therefore I don't pay for xbox live anymore. Now, clearly, this is not a fair system for weekend gamers. The younger gamers that use the service more get much more use out of the time they pay for. All I'm suggesting is that you add a feature to break up the xbox live gold time into, call it, ""arcade time."" ""Arcade time"" would only deplete when you are actually on your xbox using services. If needed, put restrictions that are seen fit on ""Arcade time."" Like, maybe arcade time users don't have access to free games with gold, or certain downloadable content. I'm suggesting this now because I am bored tonight and I don't want to pay 10 dollars for a month of service that I am only going to use for -- quite possibly -- 3 hours out of the possible 480 waking hours in a month. Now, I would pay 10 dollars for a month of time that only depletes when I use it. Hell...

Apparently, all resources I have found online states that I cannot get access to the live camera frames with c#, it was said that this could only be achieved with native C++.  I wrote a hack to override the WriteAsync method IRandmomAccessStream class in the Windows.Storage.Streams namespace. I believe this method gets called each time a new sequence of bytes is to be written from the recording camera to the stream buffer. I overrode this write method to send those sequence of bytes to the manually created web socket server which worked fine but the video was always corrupted at the receiving end. I believe this is due to some missing metadata/fragmented frames as the stream is in h.264. I want to ask if anyone has an idea of a library that can transcode the camera feed in real-time for live streaming in pure c#.","Learn, Try or Buy--Awareness or Learning"

I got a tough problem when working on a small Windows Store app using MVVM. I want to display a list of house guests from Big Brother season 14 using ListBox.

It works, but not very satisfactory, because whenever an item is removed from the ListBox, the model need to filter the whole collection and refresh the whole ListBox, which cause some performance problem, especially when the original collection is very huge.

Much of the WP8 code can be used in the Windows Store App without any changes. However, there is a problem with using the Resource Strings. In the WP8 project the Strings are stored in .resx files and can be used in code through a generic class AppResources: String msg = AppResources.MyMessageStringID;  In the WinStore project the Strings are stored in .resw files and can be used in code through a ResourceLoader: public class StringLoader { private static ResourceLoader resourceLoader = new ResourceLoader(); public static String Get(String stringName) { return resourceLoader.GetString(stringName); } } String msg = StringLoader.Get(""MyMessageStringID"");  I am looking for a way to use the same code to load the strings in both projects. My first approach was to use a compiler switch: String msg = #if NETFX_CORE StringLoader.Get(""MyMessageStringID""); #else AppResources.MyMessageStringID; #endif  Problem: The compiler switch cannot be used inline. It would have to be like this: #if NETFX_CORE String msg = StringLoader.Get(""MyMessageStringID""); #else String msg = AppResources.MyMessageStringID; #endif  While this is possible for this simple example it would create a lot of redundant code in the real projects.  Of course I could create a ""AppResources"" class for Win Store as well: public class AppResources{ private static ResourceLoader resourceLoader = new ResourceLoader(); public static String MyMessageStringID { get { return resourceLoader.GetString(""MyMessageStringID ""); } } }  Such a class is created in WP8 automatically and (as far as I know) I would have to create it manually for the Windows Store App. Since there are several hundred strings in the Projects this would very, very much work.

I would like the ability to ""register"" a script file with a tenant so that the script file can execute on every single page that is loaded. Ideally this would be something a tenant admin can do by either going to the settings page and adding one or more URLs to script files they want to execute on every page or they could also purchase an app from the store and that app would have an SPI that would register a tenant wide script include (add a permission and make the risks obvious to the user but give them the option to install it). If we can do this, run a piece of code everywhere, then it opens up the door to so many applications and customizations which right no require the user to manually modify the master page on every site collection (and in many cases sub-sites as well) across their tenant. As an app developer if I tell the user to make such a change then I also get blocked from the store so now I'm left with manually installing the app and if it's a provider hosted app then I have to deal with expiring client secrets. If I could run script on every page load then I could do things like create a global navigation app, or add analytics such as google analytics to the page, or build contextual help applications, etc. - the list of app possibilities that this would open up becomes quite extensive. I get that there are risks as the script would run as the user and could do just about anything to the site that the user could but that's exactly what is needed for the app model to work long term (in my opinion - alert the user to the risks but let them make the choice - no different than me installing an app that can take full control of everything on my phone or desktop).","Technical Operations--Deploying or Launching"

I think that people who have purchased the app/game should be able to vote on the review's helpfulness (yes/no). The reviews should then be sorted based on its percentage of helpfulness and the number of votes. User should also be able to comment on others' reviews to provide help or explain why their review isn't helpful. Finally, users should also be able to report inappropriate reviews.

I have to spend a lot of time manipulating the csv file each month just to try to get the interesting data. I hope you can change that.  There are also items under the column  `Components` that are not directly referenced to item defined in the Azure platform.   Azure is already very unpredictable in terms of pricing, as you cannot really easily estimated what a project will cost you, so Microsoft should make an effort to at least provide good data once a project is already running.   This is a major issue and a main factor for us to decide if we will use or not Azure for a particular project!","Business Operations--Business Analysis"
"2b16be4f-0d66-b0f6-c44f-e3b23cc87388","Improving the Xbox Preview Program invitation process (Access Preview program without an invite from a friend). I apologize in advance if this is in the wrong place, but I couldn't really find an appropriate section to post this.   Anyway, tonight I spoke with an Xbox Support agent trying to obtain some information about how I could gain access to the beta for EA Access. She told me I had to be a part of the Xbox Preview Program (or Beta Update Program as she called it) and referred me to the Xbox forums, recommending that I post a thread on there asking for an invite and that the engineers would look it over and let me know if I qualified.  Well, in a matter of minutes after I posted that, my thread was closed and I was left confused and in worry that this was going to ruin my chances of gaining access to the program, even though I had bad information.   So, I went back on the Xbox Support website and spoke with another live agent whom explained the actual process of gaining access to the Preview Program. This was met with more confusion on my part when the agent mentioned that I needed a friend to invite me to the program. There is one problem: I don't know anyone in the program and know a handful of people that own an Xbox One.   As I posted in the thread and told the agent, I am a very active user of my Xbox One and own a good portion of the library for the system. This is a program I am very interested in being a part of, especially because I already have experience in such things as play-testing for Ubisoft in the past.   I'm sure I'm not the only person who is interested in this program that doesn't know anyone in it that can invite them. I feel that is very unfair to us. I know I can contribute a great deal to the program, but apparently I'm not allowed access to it because I don't know anyone who can invite me and I find that very frustrating.  Thank you for your consideration  - Ty","None--Other None"

I would like to be able to distribute it with no fees charged to myself or users. (Please not that I am not asking about Windows 7-style desktop applications.) From Microsoft Community, it seems that the only way to distribute these types of applications is using Windows Store. In fact, since the removal of the term, metro, it appears to me that one of the replacement phrases is Windows Store Apps, which clearly implies a strong association with Windows Store. The licence agreement for the store appears to support distributing free applications. However, I've also read that there is no (permanently) free way to use the store as a developer. (See this, for example.)

"7a7a4e46-0bcf-4d35-0de0-98eae6ea5950","Let ppl know that they will continue to be charge even after purchasing a 3M membership at the code screen so they are aware!!!. I had purchased a 3M membership card from the store so that my checking account would not be charged for a while. My checking account still ended up being charged a week or two after me adding on my 3M membership. Since I did not have the funds for the monthly charge. My account was overdrawn and went from 9.99 to 35 dollars with the 25 dollar overdraft fee.  I contacted xbox live support/billing about this problem. I was told that yes they had made a mistake and that they would give me back my 9.99. I asked how do I go about getting my 25 dollar over draft fee?? She told me that once the 9.99 was put back into my account the bank should give me back my 25 dollars also.  The next day I contacted the bank. I was told that they are not responsible for the overdraft fee and that the party that shouldn't have taken out the money in the first place (xbox) should reimburse me for the 25 dollar overdraft fee.  I then contacted xbox live/ billing again. This time I get a totally different story. I was told that it was my fault that the money was taken out of my account. I did not see how considering I bought the 3M membership. Why would you still be charging my account?? What's the point of purchasing the 3M membership in that case?? Why give me back my 9.99 if you bare no responsibility?? I was told that I was supposed to cancel my monthly charge so that I would not be charged again. So I then asked how was I supposed to know that? And when putting in the 3M code where does It state that? I could not get an answer on where does it state that ""go Figure"".  But I was told that if I had gotten on line it would have shown me that I had 4 months membership instead of 3 and that's how I would have known. I guess I was supposed to randomly get online and check that for no apparent reason.  The way xbox live does that doesn't even make sense. When a person buys a 3M card or 1year card why would you have to cancel your monthly charge? Wouldn't it make sense for the 3m or 1year membership to take over and the one month charge to kick back in once those codes have expired??? Instead of canceling and reactivation every time you get a card.  I've given a ton of my hard earned money to xbox. I've had all the xbox systems. Not to mention all the games and memberships. And you guys can't satisfy me with this 25 dollar fee that I feel is owed to me??? I even talked to the representative supervisor and told her I don't car how they do it. Whether it's with another 3M membership, xbox online credits. I just didn't want to be at a loss for no reason. She said there was nothing she could do.   Well here is my answer to that... I have always been a Playstation loyalist! With that being said I have still supported xbox. But to get my 25 dollars worth back. I will make it my lifes mission to talk people out of buying the xbox. Now I'm sure this doesn't matter to the representatives. But any business minded person knows that word of mouth goes a long way. I don't care if I talk only one person out of buying the xboxone. You guys loose 400-500 bucks which makes me feel better about loosing 25 bucks. Truth be known I'll be able to talk more than just one person out of it. A lot of people ask me about consoles since I have them all. You can not treat people like this and expect to beat SONY! No wonder why they are selling almost twice as many systems. As I stated I may or may not keep my xboxone but I will only speak against the xbox.   Ahh now that that's off of my chest I feel a little better.\ sincerely Suprem20","None--Other None"

My current annoyance is that navigating between two related, but not the same entities is frustrating. In a tabbed browsing approach, this is a single click on the correct tab in my browser. In the new portal, this is a bunch of clicks depending on the level of shared hierarchy. Neither right clicking / middle clicking work to allow me to open a view in a new window. Please consider the target users of this portal (they're going to be power users, not n00bs). I don't know a dev out there that doesn't always have a bunch of tabs open in their browser of choice, because that's the most efficient way to work. Journeys aren't the answer to this, as they still require a navigation action / delay between actions.  The impact of this is that the new portal's behaviour is a regression from the old portal. It's a frustratingly annoying experience, significantly slower to perform similar tasks.

"a0c10414-4077-58ab-78e1-4784daea075a","Make User Friendly. just as some constructive feedback, this support website is not the most user friendly. Here are some issues I have with it:  1.) Takes too many steps to even get to the support portal. While in your Azure portal, you click support, then it takes you to a general page, you click Get Support again, then it refreshes the page with some modal popup to create or manage tickets, you then click manage tickets to finally see a list of open tickets. A better flow would be to have some sub menus under the support top menu in the Azure portal for Billing Support vs Technical Support, then by clicking Technical it would take you directly to the list of open tickets. Then if you want to open a new ticket, have a button there to do so.  2.) Viewing the support ticket history is confusing an hard to read. You have to Expand each issue to see who's reply it was. There should be a clearer header section that shows who authored the reply and the date. And I think having all of the communications collapsed by default makes it hard to find the entry you're looking for. I think it would be best if they were all expanded by default. It is much easier to scroll then have to go click and open them all individually.  3.) finally, it would be great to have an HTML editor so you can do some formatting in the body and especially have a code type formatting that allows you to paste code in and have it maintain the same look/feel as the code in your Visual Studio text editor....i.e. uses a font like Courier New and maintains tabs and line breaks, etc.","Technical Operations--Technical Operations UI or UX"

This is a large gap in functionality with the server-side object model.  It would be great to give Apps the power to create custom UserProfile Properties, and to set values for other UserProfile Properties.   For example, imagine a Twitter Feed SharePoint app. Upon installation, it would request permissions to create/read/update user profile properties. It would create a new UserProfile property called TwitterHandle. If end-users filled out this profile property with their Twitter Handle, the App could read that value and display a twitter feed for that username. It would bypass the need for a series of manual instructions for the tenant admin to perform to get the App to work. Similarly, if the user hadn't filled out the property, the App could display a UI to prompt the user to specify their Twitter handle, and could then write the value back for the end user into the User Profile Property. This would make it so the user didn't have to specifically visit the Edit Profile page in SharePoint.

"3573d4db-8994-21b0-7444-e7df59709f7f","Metro c++ async programming and UI updating. My technique?	The problem: I'm crashing when I want to render my incoming data which was retrieved asynchronously.  The app starts and displays some dialog boxes using XAML. Once the user fills in their data and clicks the login button, the XAML class has in instance of a worker class that does the HTTP stuff for me (asynchronously using IXMLHTTPRequest2). When the app has successfully logged in to the web server, my .then() block fires and I make a callback to my main xaml class to do some rendering of the assets.  I am always getting crashes in the delegate though (the main XAML class), which leads me to believe that I cannot use this approach (pure virtual class and callbacks) to update my UI. I think I am inadvertently trying to do something illegal from an incorrect thread which is a byproduct of the async calls.  Is there a better or different way that I should be notifying the main XAML class that it is time for it to update it's UI? I am coming from an iOS world where I could use NotificationCenter.  Now, I saw that Microsoft has it's own Delegate type of thing here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh755798.aspx Do you think that if I used this approach instead of my own callbacks that it would no longer crash? Let me know if you need more clarification or what not.

Always crashes. // Follow the rest of the code to get here. } // In MyUser.cpp void LoginAndGetAssets(String^ email, String^ password){ Uri^ uri = ref new URI(MY_SERVER + ""login.json""); String^ inJSON = ""some json input data here""; // serialized email and password with other data // make the HTTP request to login, then notify XAML that it has data to render. _myService->HTTPPostAsync(uri, json).then([](String^ outputJson){ String^ assets = MyParser::Parse(outputJSON); // The Login has returned and we have our json output data if(_delegate) { _delegate->UpdateUI(assets); } }); } // In MyService.cpp task MyService::HTTPPostAsync(Uri^ uri, String^ json) { return _httpRequest.PostAsync(uri, json->Data(), _cancellationTokenSource.get_token()).then([this](task response) { try { if(_httpRequest.GetStatusCode() != 200) SM_LOG_WARNING(""Status code="", _httpRequest.GetStatusCode()); String^ j = ref new String(response.get().c_str()); return j; } catch (Exception^ ex) .......; return ref new String(L""""); }, task_continuation_context::use_current()); }  Edit: BTW, the error I get when I go to update the UI is: ""An invalid parameter was passed to a function that considers invalid parameters fatal.""

Basically, I have a high speed internet connection (Optic Fiber 100mbit) and for some reason Xbox Music will RANDOMLY stutter, like it has poor buffering and is trickle feeding song data.  This is over the last several months.  The first few songs might be fine, it might run for 2 hours then it starts to stutter, or it could be the second song etc. Totally random.  I can download around 8 megabytes per SECOND so a song should be already totally downloaded before it even starts!  I can view HD videos perfectly, HD youtube etc etc, download a 2gig game in no time...  So the stuttering is a massive incompetence in the way the music service is being setup as far as I am concerned.  From what others have said (who have the same issue) and my experience, I believe that Microsoft is trickle feeding the music streams with a very small/tight buffer on the Xbox One, so even with an excellent internet connection *any* delay in data for what ever reason will result in stuttttttting music stream.  - Totally unacceptable.  Please increase the buffer significantly and all will be solved. Seriously not hard.","None--Other None"

My suggestion is for Microsoft/Xbox to change their security policies when it comes to old account retrievals. ††Being asked to provide the serial number of my original Xbox to prove that a gamertag belonged to me is beyond ludicrous. I offered plenty of alternative methods of proof - proof of identity that is fully accepted †by banks - yet was completely rebuffed. †As we all know, gamertags are attached to Microsoft accounts. These Microsoft accounts can (given enough inactivity) get archived, leaving the original gamertag orphaned. Even re-creating the same email address doesn't re-connect to the gamertag - I tried this. †This happened with an old gamertag of mine which I've tried several times to re-gain access to. I was hoping to change the gamertag to something else, to free it up for my current account. †Unfortunately Microsoft's Account Policies are incredibly antiquated to the point where I was being asked to provide the serial number of my original Xbox. This is obviously something that I no longer have access to and could not provide. ††The proof I could offer, they wouldn't accept. I also tried to offer the fact that my current gamertag had been used on the same console but they were unwilling to accept this as evidence too. †If the existing idea to expire gamertags is accepted, then that would solve my issue, but if not I would ask Microsoft/Xbox to update their security policies to the 21st century. †In my situation, the gamertag has two friends attached to it, 0GS and hasn't been used in at least 8 years. I didn't even care about getting access to it, only wanting to re-use the gamertag that I originally had. ††I just feel that the policies should allow for some discretion from the support team.

Some games have huge amounts of DLC , eg DOA5U has +300 items - finding an individual item can be frustrating.  Finding out what buying options you have in relation to 'DLC bundles' even more so.  2. The add-on section on the X360 store lists 100 of the most recent items , however the majority of them tend to belong to a small handful of games , Cod, Rocksmith, Just dance etc.   It can be easy to miss individual releases especially if customers don't check the store weekly, + it takes time to search through them all.  Solution>>>  Use folders - like on the PC.  When you select 'add-on' in the store you can be presented with a list of the 100 most recent updates , HOWEVER , it's only one tile per game. - doing this makes it easy for any user to see which games have been updated recently.  For example let's say Forza -> after selecting the tile , I'm presented with 'types' of add-on, as in TRACKS and CARS. Whichever folder/tile has new content is highlighted.  Choosing CARS - I'm presented with tiles for each car pack/bundle. The new content folder/tile is highlighted.  From choosing a car pack - I can see all of my options -> the bundle + each individual car and their prices.   Using folders adds an extra set of layers to the store but it'll make it easier for customers to see what's new, easier to find what they want and easier to see all the buying options.

I immediately contacted support. They confirmed I received the invitation and said I should be seeing something soon.  - On 9/1, having received nothing, I contacted support again. This time, they told me I had received and apparently missed my invitation. They said they would resend it and I should see something in the following couple of days. - On 9/9, having again received nothing, I contacted support yet again. This time, I was told (1) the preview program is oversubscribed (already knew that, which was the purpose of my original communication), and (2) my problem was beyond their ability to address, so I should post on a forum, the link to which is either broken or exclusive to current Preview members.   (1) doesn't bother me, but (2) is an absurd Catch-22. To have my issue addressed, I need to post to a forum, access to which will only be granted once I have no issue to address anymore.

Tech: Due to a tremendous response from our fans...[boilerplate about Preview acceptance slowdown]  Nonunique: yes, I saw that two weeks after I got invited, which is why I contacted support on the 25th  Tech: Also, preview program do have a support forum page as well and feel free to contact them too through their forum page at [link]  Nonunique: the technician on that date told me the invitation was in and being processed. That link is dead. The second time I contacted, the technician said that I was supposed to be in, but there was a message I missed or something...said the message would be resent shortly...I never received that message, which is why I'm speaking with you right now.  Tech: Yes, you may be able to receive the invitation successfully [nonunique], however, due to [boilerplate about oversubscription]. However, since you are able to get the invitation, it might be a delay, please do check within the next following days and also do keep checking your Xbox console as it will just prompt you up  for you top accept the invitation.  Nonunique: where should I check in the next few days?  Tech: Do keep checking with your emails and with your Xbox one console inbox, alright?  Nonunique: okay...I'm still confused. Am I excluded because of the slow down, and so should expect to be in? Or am I in (as I've been told twice so far), and should be expecting to hear something very soon (as I've been told twice so far)?  Tech: No worries as I would highly suggest as well to reach out preview support for this matter it is already beyond our scope[...].  Nonunique: the link you gave me doesn't work. The link I was given before went to a private forum (I needed to be a preview member in order to get in). It's okay if I'm not in, I just want to know what's going on.  Tech: Oh yes, once you are already a preview program, you can access the link I provided. As I mentioned earlier, it might be a delay on your end due to a lot if customers who are invited.

For migration tools and others that make many calls, a sudden cutoff message like this can cause significant issues. Migration jobs are multi-threaded, and transaction based in nature. We need to be able to gracefully pause a migration job before throttling occurs so that we can restart it later once resources are available. This requires some level of warning prior to throttling.   The XServerHealthScore http header response used when a single WFE starts getting overloaded is a perfect mechanism since we can pause gracefully when the number gets to for eg. 7, and then continue listening to this score, and restart when it gets to 3 or 4 and is healthy again. Since the throttling in this case goes beyond a single WFE.   I'm proposing something similar to allow tools that require more graceful exits to act prior to being throttled so that migration or other actions do not need to be restarted.

It's currently being updated in CUs and on SharePoint online without any notification of the changes being made (such as the $metadata endpoint appearing - was it in the August 2013 CU for on-prem?). We either need it to be released in a non-breaking change model (URL versioning such as the Twilio model), or messaging needs to be improved so we know when things are going to be changed.  Having a log of changes that have been made to date would be helpful, along with understanding what changes are currently in the queue.

After a month or so of inverstigation I was able to get my gamertag back along with all of the achievements and what not. However i was forced to make a new Gamertag because the hacker changed it and when i tried to revert back to my old one it said the name was not available. I then changed it to a different Gamertag (much harder to remember) but i still miss my old one. No one else has my old Gamertag but because it was once in use it can never be used again and ive seen MANY people with the same issue. We who are subject to Microsoft hacking should be allowed to restore our original Tags and should be able to once again use the Gamertag we original chose instead of forced to change it to something we never originally desired. Ive talked with multiple Microsoft representatives on this issue and all agree and say that in due time we will see the gamer comunity being able to achieve this. Many, Like myself, just want to be able to enjoy the live community with a Gamertag we desire and if no one else is using the Tag than we should be able to take back what was originally ours. ANY help on this subject would be so greatly appreciated and will further enhance many gaming experiences. Thank you. †[Mod edit: Title changed from ""Gamertag Restoration"" to reflect that the suggestion is to restore Gamertags that were changed in the event of a compromised account.]","None--Other None"

After a an hour on the portal I feel a headache coming up.  Let me try being constructive: There are two things that, for me, make it very hard to work with the portal:  Screen real estate: Everything is HUGE. The browse uses the full (vertical) screen to display only 20 items. A LOT of scrolling horizontally as well. Very little content uses up very much space. A management portal does not have to be touch enabled, but needs to be efficient.  Mix of status info and configuration UI: A lot of space is occupied by status info. If you click on the information tiles, sometime you get a larger display, sometime you end up in a configuration UI. Again, very confusing.   I understand that a portal has to look nice. But in this case, there is way to much emphasis on optics vs. usability - at least for my taste. My suggestion would be to compress the UI (from a spacing perspective) and seperate information display from configuration.","Technical Operations--Technical Operations UI or UX"

"ff847d08-6b61-4f7c-f3c9-f2498bcb02f7","Verifying in-app purchases	I'm building a Windows Store app that provides in-app purchases. I do not understand from the available documentation how does this work with multiple installations or devices. I want my users to be able to use the IAPs with multiple installations on different devices (purchase once, use on any device). Here is an excerpt from Using receipts to verify purchases:  In some situations, you may need to verify that a user purchased your app, or has made in-app content purchases. For example, imagine a game that offers downloaded content. If the user who purchased the game content wants to play it on a different Windows 8 device, you need to verify that the user already owns the content.  And also from Protecting your Windows Store app from unauthorized use:  To prevent users from employing this strategy to illegally use your apps, we have a receipt feature that allows you to validate a userís access to your app and service. Your app is able to obtain a signed receipt for any app-related transaction made through the Windows Store, such as the initial purchase of the app and any in-app purchases. Your app can then use this info to determine what services or features it can access for that user. [...] The ID of each receipt element is unique per user (and device) and you can validate it on your server to confirm that the transaction is legitimate for that user and not a fraudulent transaction. This is especially valuable when your app has its own authentication mechanism because it allows you to validate that each user that appears to have purchased your app is, in fact, a unique customer.  My questions are:  When is it necessary to have a back-end to store receipts?  When do I check the receipts in the back-end (when the app starts)? The receipt is unique per device. How does this help with multiple devices? I want my users to be able to use the IAPs on multiple devices if they purchased them once. If the receipt is used to validate legitimate transactions, does that mean the info provided by the CurrentApp component may not be authentic, but tempered by hacks? If that is so, why should I trust the original receipt in the first place?  ","Learn, Try or Buy--Self-Help Support"

When I create my blank 2013 solution and add a workflow item to my solution, I then add a simple activity `WriteToHistory`.  I then deploy my solution to my SharePoint 2013 Publishing Portal site.  After successful deployment I then attach my custom workflow to the Pages library.  During Association, I see the `Start this workflow to approve publishing a major version of an item` checxkbox is greyed out.  I then go back to my site and ensure versioning is turned on, which it was!  I then contacted Microsoft and opened up a support incident with them.  Refer to case 114031911277771.  Note:  Per the MS Support representative, it is by design that this is greyed out!  As a result this is causing my users to go through 5 clicks just to submit a page for approval.  Note:  In SharePoint 2007, this checkbox was enabled.  I am not sure why this functionality was taken out or is disabled in 2013 but please look into this for me (and others I'm sure).

Injecting JavaScript to change User Agent string	I'm trying to change the User Agent of a Webview in a Windows 8 app. At the moment, I'm currently doing this:  [DllImport(""urlmon.dll"", CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)] private static extern int UrlMkSetSessionOption(int dwOption, string pBuffer, int dwBufferLength, int dwReserved); const int URLMON_OPTION_USERAGENT = 0x10000001;  Then if I needed to change the UA to the iPhone for example:  string ua = ""Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_0 like Mac OS X)"" + ""AppleWebKit/536.26 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0 Mobile/10A5376e Safari/8536.25""; UrlMkSetSessionOption(URLMON_OPTION_USERAGENT, ua, ua.Length, 0);  This works perfectly. But unfortunately, if I'm going to submit this app to the Windows Store, I won't be able to use this method since UrlMkSetSessionOption is not officially supported in Windows 8 apps. Upon searching for alternatives I came across this. However, although that works, the page renders horribly, with barely any images or other elements being shown. So I hoped that another way to do this would be by using the WebView.InvokeScript method and injecting some JavaScript to change the UA. The problem being, to be quite honest, is that I'm a complete beginner when it comes to JavaScript. I did a bit more searching and apparently something like this (found here) would work: navigator.__defineGetter__('userAgent', function(){ return 'Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/536.26 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0 Mobile/10A5376e Safari/8536.25' // customized user agent }); navigator.userAgent; // 'foo'  But like I said, I'm a complete beginner with Javascript.

For now, I have been developing and testing from Visual Studio on my desktop computer and everything works fine. However, when I try to create an app package that I can pass along to others within my company for testing purposes, the application will not run properly. The solution includes two projects. The first is a C++ project that is set to build a dll file. The purpose for this is to expose the Direct2D and DirectWrite libraries that seem to be unaccessible to a C# project. The second project is the C# project that references this dll for drawing functions and includes a XAML interface and most of the program logic. All of this works flawlessly on my development machine from within Visual Studio (and also when installing the package). When I send the package files to other individuals within the company, the installation appears to work fine by installing with the PowerShell script. The tile appears in the start screen and the program will launch for a few seconds. The C# and XAML interface appears, but the DirectX portion of the application is not visible and the entire application shuts down within a few seconds. This makes me believe that the dll may not be installing or referenced correctly upon installation. I have checked the package file, and the dll file is included in the package after the build process is complete. I have packaged a few different test programs (MSDN Samples) that have all installed on their machines, but we get the same results that they will not run (again, all samples run fine on my development machine when building them). The only test project that worked properly was a simple C# project that did not use DirectX at all. Any of the DirectX samples that I tried have all failed (including the native C++ samples that do not use C# at all). To be clear, the process I use for building is going to Project -> Store -> Create App Packages and choosing the No option for uploading to the Windows Store. Does anyone have any ideas on what might be going wrong with the build or installation process? Thanks in advance for any help!","Technical Operations--Coding or Building"

Method call MyApp.Util.addClassById(q("".item""), item.itemId, ""selected"");  (Where item.itemId is that of my newly selected item and 'q' is an alias for WinJS.Utilities.query) Method declaration function addClassById(elements, selectedId, className) { elements.forEach(function (el) { var id = parseInt(el.attributes['data-id'].value, 10); if (id === selectedId) { util.addClass(el, className); } else { util.removeClass(el, className); } }); }  This works as expected after my listview is loaded and I'm selecting new items.

In order to attempt to play a game in full english, I had to change my region to UK, which worked, but with the issue that now no other games will download due to me not being in the UK.   The more outstanding issue here is that the account overrides all language preferences on the local Xbox, so even if I'd set my Xbox language to even something like Spanish or French, everything would still be in English.   While this is good in certain ways, this by far should not be the main language setting, and by far should not be the only way to play a game in the language you would like to play it in.   Now, since I want to download new games, I have to wait three months to be able to do so, since I cannot change it back.   The even bigger issue I can foresee with this, is, we all know about other people who like to hack into your Live account and try to change your passwords and such, but what if they changed your region? Theres little security around that, and the consequences are vast.   For example, if your Live account got compromised and someone changed your region to something remote like Chinese or Arabic, your entire Xbox language preferences would be overridden and be in that language, plus you will not be able to interface with the marketplace at all, since your IP address does not match the country in the account, this is basically a killer weapon for any live account that could be compromised.

"c71c58ef-a4f3-5005-674d-8f8973975194","Xbox One need to push digital purchases. When Xbox One was revealed, the idea was to have a all digital console, which didn't made a good impression for any reasons, mostly because the lack of the right message to the consumer.   More than one year later, what I see it's a console that in no way pushs digital, actually it's WAY better to purchase and pre-order physical games. When I saw that MS Store was selling Watch Dogs (physical copy) with a $15 gift card, it really made me sad as I bought the same game for $60 digitally and literally gained nothing.  So my point is, push better conditions on digital. You guys have nothing to lose, we can't trade digital (yet) and we're willing to go all digital if you let us. So please give us some good news and bring better digital purchase conditions! ","None--Other None"
